In my last project I experienced the advantages of making development costs transparent, and I would like to share that here.

When a product is developed, the intention is to generate a specific result (outcome) with it. Development requires effort. Effort is the input to gain the outcome. It is essential knowing the actual investment for this in order to decide which direction to take.

Hence it is required to measure the input. This leads to the question of how is it actually possible to measure input properly?

Measuring input in [Story Points](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points) or in men days are a widely known practice, but in the end these measurements are just an abstraction for what really matters for a company, which is the costs defined in money.

## Why not Story Points ?
Story points are an abstraction of time that is needed to deliver something, as described byÂ Mike Cohn [Story Points Are Still About Effort](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/story-points-are-still-about-effort).
