## Blog content
I will write about different topics related to things i have learned during my work. Due to the fact that i am currently working as a Product Owner in a Scrum Team it will be mainly related to the following topics:
* Agile Product Management
* Lean Start Up
* Scrum
* Domain Driven Design
 
Beside that i am also interested in the whole value chain of modern technology companies. So it will be most likely that i will also write about my observations in that area.

And last but not least i never lost interest in coding it self. So i will also introduce some of my development projects here in this blog.

I am very happy to get your feedback on my topics either by comment or any kind of private message. 

So i hope that you will somehow benefit from my shared experiences. 

Cheers
Gregor
