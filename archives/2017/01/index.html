	    <p>The beginning of the new year is for me as a Product Owner the moment when i work intensely on my roadmap for the upcoming year. The Product Roadmap is a strategic tool to steer the direction of the product development.

Instead of looking for a translator teams should establish a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">ubiquitous language</a> that both sides can understand to enable direct communication.<br>
