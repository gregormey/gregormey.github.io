I think this is fundamentally wrong. Instead of looking for a translator teams should establish a [ubiquitous language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) that both sides can understand to enable direct communication.\n<!-- more -->\n\nWithin the nearly 3 years of working for Goodgame Studios i was responsible for a couple of different products. I would like to share my experience in terms of the collaboration with the stakeholders for two of these projects. Both were very different.\n\n## The Marketing Backend\nThe Marketing Backend is a reporting tool for performance marketing KPI’s aggregated on monthly cohorts. The tool is used by marketing key account managers to steer marketing investments aligned by the life time value per customer.  \n\n*Current status:*\nFeature Freeze, the tool will be replaced by a self service solution.\n\n*Stakeholder:*\nAround 30 key account manager are using the tool on a daily basis. The requirements came from one key user per marketing team (SEA, Facebook, Display, RTA, TV).\n\n*Development Team:*\n- 7 Developers\n- 1 QA \n- 1 Product Owner (me) \n- 1 Agile Coach  \n\n## The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System \nThe task here is to provide customer data to a third party system that is required to communicate with the customers for marketing purposes. In  the first step the team focuses on email marketing.\n\n*Current status:*\nImplementation is still in progress. Integration of further communication channels are planned.\n\n*Stakeholder:*\nRequirements are worked out together with two email marketing managers. Besides that developers, who are using the data interface, are considered as stakeholder as well.\n\n*Development Team:*\n- 3 Developers\n- 1 Product Owner (me) \n- 1 Agile Coach\n\n## Aspects of Collaboration\n\n### Collocation\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe development team was separated from the stakeholders. For some period of time the separation was even over different buildings. A casual exchange between them was only possible in official meetings. The stakeholders were always considered as disruptive and direct communication with them was avoided. \n\n#### CRM\nDevelopers and stakeholders are sitting together at the same table. They consider themselves as one team. Issues related to their work are usually clarified directly. Both sides see what is their daily business and that fosters a mutual understanding and the willing to work collaborative together.\n\n#### Lessons learned\nDirect communication between developers and stakeholders is essential for a successful product development.  The example shows that a spatial separation of development team and stakeholders is a huge weakening of the communication flow.\n\n### Integration of stakeholders into the scrum process\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe requirements were communicated to the team with [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) tickets. Stakeholder and Product Owner met two times a week to refine these tickets. Besides that there was a bi-weekly prioritization meeting also just between stakeholders and Product Owner. Information about requirements and prioritization was communicated to the development team by the Product Owner. There was no review meeting. Instead tickets were assigned back to the stakeholders for approval after implementation. Due to that developers got very delayed feedback about their work and the backlog was rapidly growing to a size that was not manageable anymore.\n\n#### CRM\nDevelopers and stakeholders are doing their daily stand up together.

They had a lot of trouble to get into that. In some cases the developers even refused to learn something about their domain. They expected that the Product Owner will tell them what needs to be done. This lead to the fact that a lot of iterations were needed to come to a suitable solution for many requirements.\n\n#### CRM\nAlso in this case the domain was completely new for the team. But this time the team did not refused to learn. The developers had an interest in the work of the stakeholders. They are often sitting together and let the stakeholders explain their work.

As a result of that the team withdraw to an area where they felt comfortable, which was software architecture and design patterns. In the end this lead to overengineering.

The amount of requested features was not adapted to the delivery time of the team and the backlog was growing and growing.

I would like to share my experience in terms of the collaboration with the stakeholders for two of these projects. Both were very different.\n\n## The Marketing Backend\nThe Marketing Backend is a reporting tool for performance marketing KPI’s aggregated on monthly cohorts. The tool is used by marketing key account managers to steer marketing investments aligned by the life time value per customer.  \n\n*Current status:*\nFeature Freeze, the tool will be replaced by a self service solution.\n\n*Stakeholder:*\nAround 30 key account manager are using the tool on a daily basis. The requirements came from one key user per marketing team (SEA, Facebook, Display, RTA, TV).\n\n*Development Team:*\n- 7 Developers\n- 1 QA \n- 1 Product Owner (me) \n- 1 Agile Coach  \n\n## The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System \nThe task here is to provide customer data to a third party system that is required to communicate with the customers for marketing purposes. In  the first step the team focuses on email marketing.\n\n*Current status:*\nImplementation is still in progress. Integration of further communication channels are planned.\n\n*Stakeholder:*\nRequirements are worked out together with two email marketing managers. Besides that developers, who are using the data interface, are considered as stakeholder as well.\n\n*Development Team:*\n- 3 Developers\n- 1 Product Owner (me) \n- 1 Agile Coach\n\n## Aspects of Collaboration\n\n### Collocation\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe development team was separated from the stakeholders. For some period of time the separation was even over different buildings. A casual exchange between them was only possible in official meetings. The stakeholders were always considered as disruptive and direct communication with them was avoided. \n\n#### CRM\nDevelopers and stakeholders are sitting together at the same table. They consider themselves as one team. Issues related to their work are usually clarified directly. Both sides see what is their daily business and that fosters a mutual understanding and the willing to work collaborative together.\n\n#### Lessons learned\nDirect communication between developers and stakeholders is essential for a successful product development.  The example shows that a spatial separation of development team and stakeholders is a huge weakening of the communication flow.\n\n### Integration of stakeholders into the scrum process\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe requirements were communicated to the team with [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) tickets. Stakeholder and Product Owner met two times a week to refine these tickets. Besides that there was a bi-weekly prioritization meeting also just between stakeholders and Product Owner. Information about requirements and prioritization was communicated to the development team by the Product Owner. There was no review meeting. Instead tickets were assigned back to the stakeholders for approval after implementation. Due to that developers got very delayed feedback about their work and the backlog was rapidly growing to a size that was not manageable anymore.\n\n#### CRM\nDevelopers and stakeholders are doing their daily stand up together. Here they share details about the work and potential problems. Stakeholders also participate to the sprint planning and developers ask them directly for advice. Priority and product strategy are discussed on a higher level with a goal oriented roadmap. The roadmap is also maintained by all involved people together on a regular basis.

Development requires effort. Effort is the input to gain the outcome. It is essential knowing the actual investment for this in order to decide which direction to take.\n\nHence it is required to measure the input. This leads to the question of how is it actually possible to measure input properly?\n\nMeasuring input in [Story Points](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points) or in men days are a widely known practice, but in the end these measurements are just an abstraction for what really matters for a company, which is the costs defined in money.\n\n## Why not Story Points ?\nStory points are an abstraction of time that is needed to deliver something, as described by Mike Cohn [Story Points Are Still About Effort](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/story-points-are-still-about-effort). \n\nBut in my opinion, the question about how long it takes to deliver something is in the end more a question about how high the investment is for the delivery. It is hard to transform story points into money.\n\n*Examples:*\n- A team of 5 developers costs 25.000 € per sprint \n- The team has a velocity of 60 story points\n- The smallest possible unit that can be estimated is 1 story point. E.g. a task of 1 hour effort is estimated as 1.\n1 story point costs  416 € (25.000 € / 60)\n- But the normal cost per development hour is just 62,5 € (25.000 € / 5 Developer / 10 working days / 8 working hours )\n\nThe example shows that Story points do not equal time and therefore they are not suitable to calculate investments.\n\n## Why not just use time?\nDevelopment time is just one of several factors that needs to be taken into account for cost calculations. Others are:\n- [Cost of delay](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/)\n- Team Size, how many people are working in the team for a product\n- Cost of operation\n\nBesides that, time is usually conversely proportional to money. Getting something faster usually means it becomes more expensive. In very rare cases the development can be done faster with larger teams, larger teams are more expensive.  In most cases teams try to speed up the process by lowering the quality, but this will lead to follow up costs due to technical debts.\n\n> \"Greg Young on the other hand, has talked on several occasions about how technical debt is not necessarily bad. Businesses take loans all the time. They are a powerful tool to make an investment now, and pay for it later. It’s a fundamental aspect of our economy.\"\nhttp://verraes.net/2013/07/managed-technical-debt/\n\n## How to calculate costs\nBeside the cost of delay it is important to know the general team costs, which are cost of operation plus personnel costs. For the final calculation, hardware costs comes on top. For different reasons it is true, that salaries of team members should not be transparent.\n\nIn my current team we use an average per team member which is calculated over the salaries of the whole department including leads. That means that the team costs are calculated by Number of Team Members * Average Department Salary.\n\nThe costs are calculated on a monthly basis but are reported on product cost centers. This is beneficial because the outcome for a company comes from the products and not from the teams, so we want to know the investment we have to take for a dedicated product.\n\nWe split the team costs based on a monthly effort ratio in percent per product. When a team has to handle more than one product like it is in my case, we track the time spend on a product with [Lego Time Tracking](http://www.filamentpd.com/lego-time-tracking/).\n{% asset_img lego.jpg Lego Time Tracking %}\n\n## How to forecast costs\nIt is not possible to forecast costs. You can only estimate costs, but estimates have the problem, that they are always wrong.\n- http://noestimates.org/blog/\n\n## How to estimate costs\nAs a Product Owner I design my roadmap around [goals](https://scrumburg.wordpress.com/2016/06/30/business-value-poker-and-more-po-tools-nr-3/) that bring valuable outcome. We also estimate the costs for the goals, so that I can see the ratio between input and outcome.\n\nBefore the question “How long does it take?” I prefer the question: “How much time do we want to give us to reach that goal?”\n{% asset_img roadmap.png Roadmap with costs assigned to goals %}\n\n## Conclusion\nI think it is valuable for the process of product development to make costs transparent to everybody involved. With the knowledge of the cost everybody in a company can take important decisions or can better understand the motivation behind them.\n\nIt also prevents a team from wasting development time, because it makes everybody aware of the investment. In my experience this also helps to increase the commitment of everybody to their product.\n\nWith the above mentioned methods, product owners are able to define the relation between input and outcome and get a powerful tool to measure the return of investment for certain deliveries.\n\n","source":"_posts/benefits-of-transparent-costs.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Benefits of transparent costs\ntags:\n  - planning\n  - product management\n  - agile\ndate: 2016-09-14 11:14:25\n---\n\n\nIn my last project I experienced the advantages of making development costs transparent, and I would like to share that here.\n<!-- more -->\nWhen a product is developed, the intention is to generate a specific result (outcome) with it.

In my experience this also helps to increase the commitment of everybody to their product.</p>\n<p>With the above mentioned methods, product owners are able to define the relation between input and outcome and get a powerful tool to measure the return of investment for certain deliveries.</p>"}],"PostAsset":[{"_id":"source/_drafts/stakeholder-collaboration/collabo.png","slug":"collabo.png","post":"cit5surac0001grdbz53wffdd","modified":1,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_drafts/stakeholder-collaboration/intention.png","post":"cit5surac0001grdbz53wffdd","slug":"intention.png","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_drafts/stakeholder-collaboration/story_mapping.png","slug":"story_mapping.png","post":"cit5surac0001grdbz53wffdd","modified":1,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/benefits-of-transparent-costs/lego.jpg","post":"cit5surax000ggrdbllm33s79","slug":"lego.jpg","modified":1,"renderable":1},{"_id":"source/_posts/benefits-of-transparent-costs/roadmap.png","post":"cit5surax000ggrdbllm33s79","slug":"roadmap.png","modified":1,"renderable":1}],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cit5sura70000grdbcfq0tq0z","tag_id":"cit5surai0002grdbhd80ex2h","_id":"cit5surao0006grdb5u2nx9r0"},{"post_id":"cit5sura70000grdbcfq0tq0z","tag_id":"cit5suram0003grdbfkseq1ph","_id":"cit5surao0007grdbki0oyp5n"},{"post_id":"cit5sura70000grdbcfq0tq0z","tag_id":"cit5suram0004grdb406k3tyx","_id":"cit5surap0009grdb8kgl3hos"},{"post_id":"cit5surac0001grdbz53wffdd","tag_id":"cit5surai0002grdbhd80ex2h","_id":"cit5suraq000bgrdbe680vpdk"},{"post_id":"cit5surac0001grdbz53wffdd","tag_id":"cit5surap0008grdbmi2z0bpy","_id":"cit5suraq000cgrdbzhxxef47"},{"post_id":"cit5surac0001grdbz53wffdd","tag_id":"cit5surap000agrdbzpkht37y","_id":"cit5suraq000dgrdbefsjpub7"},{"post_id":"cit5surax000ggrdbllm33s79","tag_id":"cit5suraz000hgrdbfdmhpb5m","_id":"cit5surb0000igrdbxeu2dlx7"},{"post_id":"cit5surax000ggrdbllm33s79","tag_id":"cit5suram0003grdbfkseq1ph","_id":"cit5surb0000jgrdbu9t2t4kp"},{"post_id":"cit5surax000ggrdbllm33s79","tag_id":"cit5surap0008grdbmi2z0bpy","_id":"cit5surb1000kgrdbl96ir8yu"}],"Tag":[{"name":"DDD","_id":"cit5surai0002grdbhd80ex2h"},{"name":"product management","_id":"cit5suram0003grdbfkseq1ph"},{"name":"aglie","_id":"cit5suram0004grdb406k3tyx"},{"name":"agile","_id":"cit5surap0008grdbmi2z0bpy"},{"name":"scrum","_id":"cit5surap000agrdbzpkht37y"},{"name":"planning","_id":"cit5suraz000hgrdbfdmhpb5m"}]}}
