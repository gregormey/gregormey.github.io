Meiner Erfahrung nach ist es notwendig ein Problem in dem gesamt Prozess zu identifiziern welches man mit einem inhouse Produkt lösen kann. Ich denke es ist besser zu vermeiden Mitarbeiter nach ihren wünschen oder verbesserungs vorschlägen zu fragen.

Man muss bedenken, dass der Buy-In nicht ewig halten wird und man als Produkt Owner so schnell wie möglich beweisen muss, das eine Lösung des identifizieren Problems zu dem erwarteten Erfolg führt. In dieser Phase ist es wichtig den Kontext des Produktes klar abzugrenzen und sich klar auf ein Ziel zu fokusieren. Auch die angestrebte technische Lösung sollte so clever und somit minimal wie nur irgendwie möglich sein. Ich habe schon häufig erelbt das Produkte an dieser Pahase scheitern. Ich denke aber es ist besser nicht an der Qualitt zu sparen um schneller zu sein. Man sollte eher versuchen die angestrebte Lösung so klein wie möglich zu halten. Hier ist kreativität und eine enge <a href=\"http://link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Zusammenarbeit</a> zwischen PO Team und Stakeholder erforderlich.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"Gain-attention\"><a href=\"#Gain-attention\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Gain attention\"></a>Gain attention</h2><p>Backend Produkte laufen immer Gefahr nicht verstanden zu werden. Was genau macht das Team? Ist eine Frage die man als Backend PO haüfig aufwendiger erklären muss als andere Product Owner. Wenn man sicherstellen konnte das man mit seinem Produkt einen Beitrag zu der Wertschöpfunkskette leisten kann in dem man ein explizites Problem gelöst hat ist es wichtig ein wenig internes Marketing zu betreiben, damit das Produkt den Support den es braucht nicht verliert. Neben dem reinen reden über das Produkt mit den richtigen Leuten ist es auch wichtig das Tool zugänglich zu machen. Haben wir Daten die wir regelmäßig veröffentlichen können ? Können genug leute im Unternhemend as Produkt nutzen? Manchmal kann es auch helfen über andere User Interfaces wie mobile nachzudenken um die Nutzbarkeit zu erhöhen.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"A-gracefull-hand-over\"><a href=\"#A-gracefull-hand-over\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A gracefull hand over\"></a>A gracefull hand over</h2><p>Do not fall in love with your product.

In this article i like to explain the format i usually use to create my roadmap. \n<!-- more -->\n\n{% asset_img Sun-Tzu-Final.gif Sun Tzu -  The Art of War %}\n\n## The Roadmap Level\n\nI see the roadmap on a level between the Product Vision and the Sprint Goals. The roadmap explains the next important goals that have to be reached to come closer to the vision. The single goal sets the focus for the next 2 to 3 sprints.\n\nUsually i define concrete roadmap goals for the next quarter (3 month) and i prioritize them against each other to make clear what the team will be working on during that period. To be able to give a prospect of what could be important for the product after we have reached the next defined goals i also formulate some further ideas beyond this 3 month period. \n\nBased on my experience i think it is useless to define detailed User Stories for the goals as long as they are not work in progress.

Therefore they have to make clear what needs to be achieved in a way that the team is able to focus on them. In the past it worked for me to communicate the following three points per goal:\n \n### Goal\nDefines as clear as possible what needs to be reached. This helps to give it a name when you are talking about it.\n\n### Value Proposition\nDescribes the value for the product or the company when the goal is reached. This point makes clear why we think something should be done.  \n\n### Metrics\nLists 1 to 2 relevant KPIs which can be used to measure the success. \n\n### ToDos \nA short summary about the issues that have to be solved.

The question we try to answer together is:\n\n\"How much time do we want to give us to reach that goal ?\"\n\nIt is important for me to get a commitment from the team for the timeline. I expect that the whole team tries to stick to the self-determined deadlines afterwards.   \n\n## The plan is nothing, planning is everything \nI think it is important to understand that a roadmap should never be written in stone. It is a working artifact that needs to be adopted every time when it is required. This could be the case, when we learned something during the development process that allows us to define the direction of the product development in a better way.

The Product Roadmap is a strategic tool to steer the direction of the product development. Sprint Goals and User Stories are tactical tools which deal with the next reasonable thing to do to reach a strategic goal. In this article i like to explain the format i usually use to create my roadmap.<br>","more":"</p>\n<img src=\"/2017/01/04/The-Product-Roadmap/Sun-Tzu-Final.gif\" alt=\"Sun Tzu - The Art of War\" title=\"Sun Tzu - The Art of War\">\n<h2 id=\"The-Roadmap-Level\"><a href=\"#The-Roadmap-Level\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Roadmap Level\"></a>The Roadmap Level</h2><p>I see the roadmap on a level between the Product Vision and the Sprint Goals. The roadmap explains the next important goals that have to be reached to come closer to the vision. The single goal sets the focus for the next 2 to 3 sprints.</p>\n<p>Usually i define concrete roadmap goals for the next quarter (3 month) and i prioritize them against each other to make clear what the team will be working on during that period. To be able to give a prospect of what could be important for the product after we have reached the next defined goals i also formulate some further ideas beyond this 3 month period. </p>\n<p>Based on my experience i think it is useless to define detailed User Stories for the goals as long as they are not work in progress. This is the reason why i create only very large stories for the goals were the team does not currently work on. This leaves the opportunity open to react on changes as they occur and to let learnings influence the further refinement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Backlog-Model\"><a href=\"#Backlog-Model\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Backlog Model\"></a>Backlog Model</h3><img src=\"/2017/01/04/The-Product-Roadmap/Backlog.png\" alt=\"When a goal gets more relevant the stories are getting smaller\" title=\"When a goal gets more relevant the stories are getting smaller\">\n<h2 id=\"Goal-Definition\"><a href=\"#Goal-Definition\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal Definition\"></a>Goal Definition</h2><p>The goals on the roadmap define an expected result.

It is essential knowing the actual investment for this in order to decide which direction to take.\n\nHence it is required to measure the input. This leads to the question of how is it actually possible to measure input properly?\n\nMeasuring input in [Story Points](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points) or in men days are a widely known practice, but in the end these measurements are just an abstraction for what really matters for a company, which is the costs defined in money.\n\n## Why not Story Points ?\nStory points are an abstraction of time that is needed to deliver something, as described by Mike Cohn [Story Points Are Still About Effort](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/story-points-are-still-about-effort). \n\nBut in my opinion, the question about how long it takes to deliver something is in the end more a question about how high the investment is for the delivery. It is hard to transform story points into money.\n\n*Examples:*\n- A team of 5 developers costs 25.000 € per sprint \n- The team has a velocity of 60 story points\n- The smallest possible unit that can be estimated is 1 story point.

Others are:\n- [Cost of delay](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/)\n- Team Size, how many people are working in the team for a product\n- Cost of operation\n\nBesides that, time is usually conversely proportional to money. Getting something faster usually means it becomes more expensive. In very rare cases the development can be done faster with larger teams, larger teams are more expensive.  In most cases teams try to speed up the process by lowering the quality, but this will lead to follow up costs due to technical debts.\n\n> \"Greg Young on the other hand, has talked on several occasions about how technical debt is not necessarily bad.

For the final calculation, hardware costs comes on top. For different reasons it is true, that salaries of team members should not be transparent.\n\nIn my current team we use an average per team member which is calculated over the salaries of the whole department including leads.

In most cases teams try to speed up the process by lowering the quality, but this will lead to follow up costs due to technical debts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Greg Young on the other hand, has talked on several occasions about how technical debt is not necessarily bad. Businesses take loans all the time. They are a powerful tool to make an investment now, and pay for it later. It’s a fundamental aspect of our economy.”<br><a href=\"http://verraes.net/2013/07/managed-technical-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://verraes.net/2013/07/managed-technical-debt/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"How-to-calculate-costs\"><a href=\"#How-to-calculate-costs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to calculate costs\"></a>How to calculate costs</h2><p>Beside the cost of delay it is important to know the general team costs, which are cost of operation plus personnel costs. For the final calculation, hardware costs comes on top. For different reasons it is true, that salaries of team members should not be transparent.</p>\n<p>In my current team we use an average per team member which is calculated over the salaries of the whole department including leads. That means that the team costs are calculated by Number of Team Members * Average Department Salary.</p>\n<p>The costs are calculated on a monthly basis but are reported on product cost centers. This is beneficial because the outcome for a company comes from the products and not from the teams, so we want to know the investment we have to take for a dedicated product.</p>\n<p>We split the team costs based on a monthly effort ratio in percent per product. When a team has to handle more than one product like it is in my case, we track the time spend on a product with <a href=\"http://www.filamentpd.com/lego-time-tracking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Lego Time Tracking</a>.<br><img src=\"/2016/09/14/benefits-of-transparent-costs/lego.jpg\" alt=\"Lego Time Tracking\" title=\"Lego Time Tracking\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"How-to-forecast-costs\"><a href=\"#How-to-forecast-costs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to forecast costs\"></a>How to forecast costs</h2><p>It is not possible to forecast costs.

With the knowledge of the cost everybody in a company can take important decisions or can better understand the motivation behind them.</p>\n<p>It also prevents a team from wasting development time, because it makes everybody aware of the investment.

In my opinion it does not matter if you choose this or a less official way, the important points are as follow:\n\n- An iterative process including regular reviews (e.g. Scrum).\n- After every iteration the customer has the opportunity to stop the project or to give the job for the next iteration instead of just paying for time and material. \n- The whole process has to aim for delivering something valuable at the end of every iteration, which is usually working software.\n- There is the possibility to adjust the requirements at least after every iteration to benefit from the learned during the work.\n- The partner commits to reach a goal with you and not to just implement requirements.\n- Direct communication is always possible.\n\n## How to choose an external partner\nIt is literally impossible to choose a good external partner just by the price.

To be able to transform the weighting to a score we calculated the ratio in percent of every question from the total amount of weighting points.</p>\n<img src=\"/2016/09/26/outsourcing-product-development/weighting.png\" alt=\"calculate weighting in percent\" title=\"calculate weighting in percent\">\n<p>A side effect was that with the accumulated points per criteria, we were able to see which criteria was the most important for us. </p>\n<p>The questionnaire was send to the candidates, so that they could answer. After we got all the answers we ranked them on a scale from 1 (not what we expect) to 10 (very close to the ideal answer). In combination with the weighting in percent we were now able to generate a score per partner from 1 to 10.</p>\n<img src=\"/2016/09/26/outsourcing-product-development/value.png\" alt=\"calculate value score\" title=\"calculate value score\">\n<p>In the last step we were able to find the best partner by the ratio between the price and the achieved score.</p>\n<img src=\"/2016/09/26/outsourcing-product-development/ratio.png\" alt=\"find partner by ratio\" title=\"find partner by ratio\">\n<h2 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h2><p>Outsourcing of product development can be an opportunity, if you know in which area of your business you can afford a risk that comes from the loss of control. It is advisable to use agile methods to manage the development process, because it gives you tools and techniques to keep control over the process even with external partners.</p>\n<p>It is not enough to choose the right external partner just by the best price. It is much more important to find the right qualitative measurements to objectively evaluate the best partner for your intent. As it is described above a value benefit analysis can be a tool for that. </p>"},{"title":"What's this blog about","date":"2016-09-09T09:14:25.000Z","_content":"Welcome.

I think this is fundamentally wrong. Instead of looking for a translator teams should establish a [ubiquitous language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) that both sides can understand to enable direct communication.\n<!-- more -->\n\nIn my career so far, i was responsible for a couple of different products. I would like to share my experience in terms of the collaboration with the stakeholders for two of these projects. Both were very different.\n\n## The Marketing Backend\nThe Marketing Backend is a reporting tool for performance marketing KPI’s aggregated on monthly cohorts. The tool is used by marketing key account managers to steer marketing investments aligned by the life time value per customer.  \n\n*Stakeholder:*\nAround 30 key account manager are using the tool on a daily basis. The requirements came from one key user per marketing team (SEA, Facebook, Display, RTA, TV).\n\n*Development Team:*\n- 7 Developers\n- 1 QA \n- 1 Product Owner (me) \n- 1 Agile Coach  \n\n## The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System \nThe task here is to provide customer data to a third party system that is required to communicate with the customers for marketing purposes. In  the first step the team focuses on email marketing.\n\n*Stakeholder:*\nRequirements are worked out together with two email marketing managers. Besides that developers, who are using the data interface, are considered as stakeholder as well.\n\n*Development Team:*\n- 3 Developers\n- 1 Product Owner (me) \n- 1 Agile Coach\n\n## Aspects of Collaboration\n\n### Collocation\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe development team was separated from the stakeholders. For some period of time the separation was even over different buildings. A casual exchange between them was only possible in official meetings. The stakeholders were always considered as disruptive and direct communication with them was avoided. \n\n#### CRM\nDevelopers and stakeholders are sitting together at the same table. They consider themselves as one team. Issues related to their work are usually clarified directly. Both sides see what is their daily business and that fosters a mutual understanding and the willing to work collaborative together.\n\n#### Lessons learned\nDirect communication between developers and stakeholders is essential for a successful product development.  The example shows that a spatial separation of development team and stakeholders is a huge weakening of the communication flow.\n\n### Integration of stakeholders into the scrum process\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe requirements were communicated to the team with [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) tickets. Stakeholder and Product Owner met two times a week to refine these tickets. Besides that there was a bi-weekly prioritization meeting also just between stakeholders and Product Owner. Information about requirements and prioritization was communicated to the development team by the Product Owner. There was no review meeting. Instead tickets were assigned back to the stakeholders for approval after implementation. Due to that developers got very delayed feedback about their work and the backlog was rapidly growing to a size that was not manageable anymore.\n\n#### CRM\nDevelopers and stakeholders are doing their daily stand up together. Here they share details about the work and potential problems. Stakeholders also participate to the sprint planning and developers ask them directly for advice. Priority and product strategy are discussed on a higher level with a goal oriented roadmap. The roadmap is also maintained by all involved people together on a regular basis. There is a review meeting after every sprint were the development team collects feedback about their current iteration from a extended circle of stakeholders. \n\n#### Lessons learned\nIt is mandatory for the developers to get early feedback about their current work from the stakeholders. The Product Owner should never be a buffer between the team and the stakeholders. Rather he must take care that both sides are connected and that they clarify issues on their own.\n\n### Domain Knowledge sharing \n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe domain “performance marketing” was a complete new topic for the development team.  They had a lot of trouble to get into that. In some cases the developers even refused to learn something about their domain. They expected that the Product Owner will tell them what needs to be done. This lead to the fact that a lot of iterations were needed to come to a suitable solution for many requirements.\n\n#### CRM\nAlso in this case the domain was completely new for the team. But this time the team did not refused to learn. The developers had an interest in the work of the stakeholders. They are often sitting together and let the stakeholders explain their work. As a kick off we did a [Story Mapping](http://jpattonassociates.com/storymappingslides/) workshop. Here we worked out together the complete email marketing workflow. In that way basic question could be asked before we started the work.\n\n{% asset_img story_mapping.png Story Mapping Workshop %}\n\n#### Lessons learned\nTo solve the problems of the business it is required to understand the business needs. It is mandatory to inspire curiosity for the business side from the beginning on, so that developers are willing to learn what they needed to know for building their product. It is the task of a product owner to foster that process and again to connect both sides.\n\n### Shared Commitment\n\n#### Marketing Backend\nThe “big picture” and the value of the product for the company was not transparent for the development team. As a result of that the team withdraw to an area where they felt comfortable, which was software architecture and design patterns. In the end this lead to overengineering. Stakeholder on the other side did not had  any appreciation for that, they were just wondering why implementation time was getting longer and longer. The amount of requested features was not adapted to the delivery time of the team and the backlog was growing and growing. Developers and stakeholders were not working on the same goal.\n\n#### CRM\nThere is a clear communicated vision for the team. Plannings on roadmap level or for the next sprint are always done in collaboration with the stakeholders. Necessary adjustments of the current sprint are always done in agreement with the whole team. The team always takes care that everybody is able to speak up when there are any doubts. Stakeholder and developers work together goal oriented.\n\n#### Lessons learned\nEvery role in a product development team has its own intention to build a great product. Which means that the intentions might be different but the goal is the same. A successful product needs all aspects, therefore it is crucial to set a common goal and let everybody work in the same direction\n\n{% asset_img intention.png Every role in a team has different intentions %}\n\n## Conclusion\nI am blaming the Marketing Backend here a bit too much. I also need to mention that during my work on that product i was together with great people and the product is still a major part of the success of the performance marketing team. Besides that, everything written here is only from my perspective.  \n\nThe above mentioned examples have all in common, that it went wrong when the direct communication between the development team and the stakeholders was not possible. It is important that both sides can learn from each other. It shows that transparency and trust is necessary for a successful product development.\n\n{% asset_img collabo.png Event Stroming Workshop %}\nDeveloper and stakeholder are working together on a Domain Model\n","source":"_posts/stakeholder-collaboration.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Stakeholder collaboration\ntags:\n  - DDD\n  - agile\n  - scrum\ndate: 2016-09-19 11:06:06\n---\n\nThe Product Owner is often meant to be the translator between the business language and the technical language of the developers.

Both were very different.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Marketing-Backend\"><a href=\"#The-Marketing-Backend\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Marketing Backend\"></a>The Marketing Backend</h2><p>The Marketing Backend is a reporting tool for performance marketing KPI’s aggregated on monthly cohorts. The tool is used by marketing key account managers to steer marketing investments aligned by the life time value per customer.  </p>\n<p><em>Stakeholder:</em><br>Around 30 key account manager are using the tool on a daily basis. The requirements came from one key user per marketing team (SEA, Facebook, Display, RTA, TV).</p>\n<p><em>Development Team:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 Developers</li>\n<li>1 QA </li>\n<li>1 Product Owner (me) </li>\n<li>1 Agile Coach  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"The-Customer-Relationship-Management-CRM-System\"><a href=\"#The-Customer-Relationship-Management-CRM-System\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System\"></a>The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System</h2><p>The task here is to provide customer data to a third party system that is required to communicate with the customers for marketing purposes. In  the first step the team focuses on email marketing.</p>\n<p><em>Stakeholder:</em><br>Requirements are worked out together with two email marketing managers. Besides that developers, who are using the data interface, are considered as stakeholder as well.</p>\n<p><em>Development Team:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 Developers</li>\n<li>1 Product Owner (me) </li>\n<li>1 Agile Coach</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Aspects-of-Collaboration\"><a href=\"#Aspects-of-Collaboration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Aspects of Collaboration\"></a>Aspects of Collaboration</h2><h3 id=\"Collocation\"><a href=\"#Collocation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Collocation\"></a>Collocation</h3><h4 id=\"Marketing-Backend\"><a href=\"#Marketing-Backend\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Marketing Backend\"></a>Marketing Backend</h4><p>The development team was separated from the stakeholders. For some period of time the separation was even over different buildings. A casual exchange between them was only possible in official meetings. The stakeholders were always considered as disruptive and direct communication with them was avoided. </p>\n<h4 id=\"CRM\"><a href=\"#CRM\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CRM\"></a>CRM</h4><p>Developers and stakeholders are sitting together at the same table. They consider themselves as one team. Issues related to their work are usually clarified directly. Both sides see what is their daily business and that fosters a mutual understanding and the willing to work collaborative together.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Lessons-learned\"><a href=\"#Lessons-learned\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Lessons learned\"></a>Lessons learned</h4><p>Direct communication between developers and stakeholders is essential for a successful product development.  The example shows that a spatial separation of development team and stakeholders is a huge weakening of the communication flow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Integration-of-stakeholders-into-the-scrum-process\"><a href=\"#Integration-of-stakeholders-into-the-scrum-process\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Integration of stakeholders into the scrum process\"></a>Integration of stakeholders into the scrum process</h3><h4 id=\"Marketing-Backend-1\"><a href=\"#Marketing-Backend-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Marketing Backend\"></a>Marketing Backend</h4><p>The requirements were communicated to the team with <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Jira</a> tickets. Stakeholder and Product Owner met two times a week to refine these tickets. Besides that there was a bi-weekly prioritization meeting also just between stakeholders and Product Owner. Information about requirements and prioritization was communicated to the development team by the Product Owner. There was no review meeting. Instead tickets were assigned back to the stakeholders for approval after implementation. Due to that developers got very delayed feedback about their work and the backlog was rapidly growing to a size that was not manageable anymore.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CRM-1\"><a href=\"#CRM-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CRM\"></a>CRM</h4><p>Developers and stakeholders are doing their daily stand up together. Here they share details about the work and potential problems. Stakeholders also participate to the sprint planning and developers ask them directly for advice. Priority and product strategy are discussed on a higher level with a goal oriented roadmap. The roadmap is also maintained by all involved people together on a regular basis. There is a review meeting after every sprint were the development team collects feedback about their current iteration from a extended circle of stakeholders. </p>\n<h4 id=\"Lessons-learned-1\"><a href=\"#Lessons-learned-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Lessons learned\"></a>Lessons learned</h4><p>It is mandatory for the developers to get early feedback about their current work from the stakeholders. The Product Owner should never be a buffer between the team and the stakeholders. Rather he must take care that both sides are connected and that they clarify issues on their own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Domain-Knowledge-sharing\"><a href=\"#Domain-Knowledge-sharing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Domain Knowledge sharing\"></a>Domain Knowledge sharing</h3><h4 id=\"Marketing-Backend-2\"><a href=\"#Marketing-Backend-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Marketing Backend\"></a>Marketing Backend</h4><p>The domain “performance marketing” was a complete new topic for the development team.  They had a lot of trouble to get into that. In some cases the developers even refused to learn something about their domain. They expected that the Product Owner will tell them what needs to be done. This lead to the fact that a lot of iterations were needed to come to a suitable solution for many requirements.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CRM-2\"><a href=\"#CRM-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CRM\"></a>CRM</h4><p>Also in this case the domain was completely new for the team. But this time the team did not refused to learn. The developers had an interest in the work of the stakeholders. They are often sitting together and let the stakeholders explain their work. As a kick off we did a <a href=\"http://jpattonassociates.com/storymappingslides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Story Mapping</a> workshop. Here we worked out together the complete email marketing workflow. In that way basic question could be asked before we started the work.</p>\n<img src=\"/2016/09/19/stakeholder-collaboration/story_mapping.png\" alt=\"Story Mapping Workshop\" title=\"Story Mapping Workshop\">\n<h4 id=\"Lessons-learned-2\"><a href=\"#Lessons-learned-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Lessons learned\"></a>Lessons learned</h4><p>To solve the problems of the business it is required to understand the business needs. It is mandatory to inspire curiosity for the business side from the beginning on, so that developers are willing to learn what they needed to know for building their product. It is the task of a product owner to foster that process and again to connect both sides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Shared-Commitment\"><a href=\"#Shared-Commitment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Shared Commitment\"></a>Shared Commitment</h3><h4 id=\"Marketing-Backend-3\"><a href=\"#Marketing-Backend-3\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Marketing Backend\"></a>Marketing Backend</h4><p>The “big picture” and the value of the product for the company was not transparent for the development team. As a result of that the team withdraw to an area where they felt comfortable, which was software architecture and design patterns. In the end this lead to overengineering. Stakeholder on the other side did not had  any appreciation for that, they were just wondering why implementation time was getting longer and longer. The amount of requested features was not adapted to the delivery time of the team and the backlog was growing and growing. Developers and stakeholders were not working on the same goal.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CRM-3\"><a href=\"#CRM-3\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CRM\"></a>CRM</h4><p>There is a clear communicated vision for the team. Plannings on roadmap level or for the next sprint are always done in collaboration with the stakeholders. Necessary adjustments of the current sprint are always done in agreement with the whole team. The team always takes care that everybody is able to speak up when there are any doubts. Stakeholder and developers work together goal oriented.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Lessons-learned-3\"><a href=\"#Lessons-learned-3\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Lessons learned\"></a>Lessons learned</h4><p>Every role in a product development team has its own intention to build a great product. Which means that the intentions might be different but the goal is the same. A successful product needs all aspects, therefore it is crucial to set a common goal and let everybody work in the same direction</p>\n<img src=\"/2016/09/19/stakeholder-collaboration/intention.png\" alt=\"Every role in a team has different intentions\" title=\"Every role in a team has different intentions\">\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I am blaming the Marketing Backend here a bit too much. I also need to mention that during my work on that product i was together with great people and the product is still a major part of the success of the performance marketing team. Besides that, everything written here is only from my perspective.  </p>\n<p>The above mentioned examples have all in common, that it went wrong when the direct communication between the development team and the stakeholders was not possible. It is important that both sides can learn from each other. It shows that transparency and trust is necessary for a successful product development.</p>\n<img src=\"/2016/09/19/stakeholder-collaboration/collabo.png\" alt=\"Event Stroming Workshop\"
